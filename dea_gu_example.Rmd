# Read Data

The following except was pulled by creating custom data files on the [IPEDS](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data) data page at NCES.  (My kingdom for an API to call!)  These data are from 2016-17.

## Sniff Test

Were unitids assigned correctly in THE data?

```{r}

  mutate(delta = `Student FTE` - `FTE Enrollment`,
         oddball = ifelse(abs(delta) > 10000, `Institution Name`, "")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(`Student FTE`, `FTE Enrollment`)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label = oddball), hjust = 0, vjust = 0) +

       x = "IPEDS",

```

# Models

Each model takes a vector of input variables and a vector of output variables.  It returns the efficiency estimates (theta) and a square matrix of weights (lambda) that can be used to etimate the areas of greatest inefficiency for the inefficient (< 1.0) units on each efficiency measure.

```{r}

    "Total Degree Awards"),      
  "Research",
  c("Faculty FTE",
    "Institutional Investment"),
  c("THE Research Score",
